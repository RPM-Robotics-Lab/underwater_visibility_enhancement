# Underwater Visibility Enhancement

This repository contains the source code for [Visibility Enhancement for Underwater Visual SLAM based on Underwater Light Scattering Model](http://irap.kaist.ac.kr/publications/ycho-2017-icra.pdf) in ICRA 2017.
The matlab code is implemented on MATLAB R2015b. 

# Usage 
Predefined configuration is saved in each dataset folder. If there is no exising configuration you can use "config" script in the project matlab root directory for the default configuration.
Currently, we add the sample degraded image from [ACFR Marine Robotics Datasets](http://marine.acfr.usyd.edu.au/datasets/).
